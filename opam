synopsis: "Easy OCaml scripts"
description: """\
B0caml runs OCaml scripts like `ocaml`. However it provides direct
support for using third-party modules and compiles scripts
transparently to a cache of native (or bytecode) executables.

B0caml is distributed under the ISC license and depends on [`b0`][b0]
and [`cmdliner`][cmdliner]. It is pronounced /bokamɛl/ with a thick
french accent.
